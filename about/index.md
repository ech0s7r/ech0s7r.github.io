Hi,  
I'm a software engineer by passion, then profession, with main interests in:

* ```Android native development```
* ```AOSP hacking```
* ```Embedded systems```
* ```Real-time development```
* ```Unix/Linux system```
* ```System/Object design```

In general everything about open source and computer science,
I enjoy working with the latest technologies.
<br/>
I develop since I was 10 years old and I've always used linux as main system, since 
few years ago I'm using OS X as the main system, but I cannot live without shell.
<br>
My favorite languages are C and Kotlin.
